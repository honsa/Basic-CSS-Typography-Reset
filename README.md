# Basic CSS Typography Reset
Essential CSS Typography Set

You probably donâ€™t need CSS Reset. What do you need is: set the HTML elements once.

In my previous project CSS Micro Reset I stated that we often set HTML multiple times and I wanted to provide minimal CSS reset https://github.com/vladocar/CSS-Micro-Reset

In this project I want to implement some basic typography for the most commonly used HTML elements.
